# -Building-a-Distributed-Key-Value-Store-with-etcd
Cloud Computing Miniproject

etcd is a reliable key value store for the most critical data of a distributed system.
This project builds a distributed key-value store using etcd.
The advantage of etcd is that it allows cloud native applications to have better uptime, and makes the servers in a distributed system more robust to failures and independent.

Python programming language is used for its ease of use and a larger standard library

Requirements and points of note:
Need to install the etcd module- pip install etcd3
Keep the server running in a terminal and open a new terminal to run the python file
Do not change the port number in the python file; 2379 is a standard port used by etcd
